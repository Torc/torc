/*! \class TorcQThread
 *  \brief A Torc specific wrapper around QThread.
 *
 * TorcQThread performs basic Torc thread setup when a new thread is started (principally
 * logging initialisation and random number seeding) and cleanup (logging and database cleanup)
 * when a thread is exiting.
 *
 * Subclass TorcQThread and reimplement Start and Finish to add additional code that will
 * be executed in the new thread after initialisation and just before exiting respectively.
 *
 * To trigger code in other objects, use the TorcQThread specific Started and Finished signals
 * (instead of 'started' and 'finished', as provided by QThread).
 *
 * \note Torc database access is restricted to full TorcQThreads and is disallowed from QRunnable subclasses.
 *
 * \todo Make run private again and enfore event driven loops for all classes.
