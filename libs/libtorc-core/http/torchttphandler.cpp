/*! \class TorcHTTPHandler
 *  \brief Base HTTP response handler class.
 *
 * A TorcHTTPHandler object will be passed TorcHTTPRequest objects to process.
 * Handlers are registered with the HTTP server using TorcHTTPServer::RegisterHandler and
 * are removed with TorcHTTPServer::DeregisterHandler. The handler's signature tells the server
 * which URL the handler is expecting to process (e.g. /events).
 *
 * Concrete subclasses must implement ProcessRequest.
