libtorc-av is a clone of FFmpeg version 1.2

git://git.videolan.org/ffmpeg.git

For local modifications see the patches directory. Any modifications to FFmpeg must include an associated
patch to ensure changes can be easily re-applied after a resync with the upstream version.

The Torc configure script (in the root directory) is a modified version of the FFmpeg configure script and
it must be also updated following any resync. Changes are tracked in configure.diff in the root directory.
